* In 2021 with the XPS13 9380 with Intel UHD Graphics 620 running X11 I noticed intense screen tearing on the laptop screen. The behavior was especially bad with terminal emulators. I noticed it when I began using a second  monotor (problem was only with the Laptop screen), but it would happen even when it was disconnected.

* To fix the issue, I added this to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d:
20-intel.conf:
"""
Section "Device"
	Identifier "Intel Graphics"
    	Driver "intel"
	Option "TripleBuffer" "true"
    	Option "TearFree" "true"
EndSection
"""

* Make sure xf86-video-intel driver is installed (for this particular chip. Consult the arch wiki to be sure)
