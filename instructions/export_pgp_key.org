#+title: Export Pgp Key

* note: your keys are backed up to electron
* there are many reasons to export a gpg/pgp key
* pass for ios:
- this gives me a headache every time the key expires.
- note that they need to be exported in ascii format for the pass ios app. that's what the --armor flag does
- to export public key:
  - gpg --armor --export YOUR_KEY_ID > public-key.asc
- to export private key:
  - gpg --armor --export-secret-keys YOUR_KEY_ID > private-key.asc
- then add them to dropbox
- go to phone
- go to dropbox
- share
- download each key to the device (iphone)
- they can then be accessed through the pass for ios app
- be sure to delete the keys from the filesystem when done
* export to a secondary device in case the primary gets destroyed
- if I lost my laptop, my keys would be gone and I would never be able to view my passwords or org roam stuff again
- I stored them on electron
- export public:
  - gpg --export YOUR_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL > public-key.gpg
- export private:
  - gpg --export-secret-keys YOUR_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL > private-key.gpg
- import public on another machine:
  - gpg --import public-key.gpg
- import private on another machine:
  - gpg --import private-key.gpg
