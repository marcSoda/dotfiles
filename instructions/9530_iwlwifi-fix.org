- symptoms: system starts fine wifi works, but at a random time a ton of stuff stops working for multiple minutes
- can't run dmesg, can't connect to internet, can't ping, etc
- after many minutes, everything starts working again. dmesg contains a ton of iwlwifi errors
- I have no idea why this happens
- fix:
  - create and add to `/etc/modprobe.d/iwl.conf`
    #+BEGIN_SRC
    options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1 swcrypto=0 bt_coex_active=0 power_save=0
    options iwlmvm power_scheme=1
    options iwlwifi d0i3_disable=1
    options iwlwifi uapsd_disable=1
    options iwlwifi lar_disable=1
    #+END_SRC
- not sure why this works. not totally sure this is what acually worked. there was a firmware update right after I did this
- NOTE: switching from netctl to network manager may have also fixed this. not sure
- only do this if you notice the error
