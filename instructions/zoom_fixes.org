* audio
- make sure mic in unmuted and "Analog Stereo Duplex" is selected in the "Configuration" tab of pavucontrol/ncpamixer
- may have to adjust volume. On the xps15 9510, 20% works good
- set suppress background audio to medium
* screen sharing
** screen really dim:
- in zoom, go to settings -> share screen -> advanced -> untick show screen border around shared content
- the green border places an x window over everything that picum mistakenly blurrs
** black boxes
- settings -> share screen -> tick show my zoom windows to other participants when I am sharing screen
- when this is unticked, zoom places huge grey bars over the zoom windows that are very distracting
