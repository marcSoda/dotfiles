#+title: Protonmail Bridge

- install `protonmail-bridge-nokeychain` from the aur
  - the reason why we need the nokeychain variant is because the regular protonmail-bridge uses pass to store some passwords, which means it needs to decrypt those passwords with my gpg key, which means that I will be prompted for my password each time I start the machine. this is not ideal. nokeychain bypasses this, I'm sure there's some nominal security implications, but I don't care.
- install `bridge-utils`
- run `protonmail-bridge --cli`
  - `login`
    - follow the prompts
  - `info`
    - this is your authentication for thunderbird or whatever mail client you're using
- create systemd unit file for bridge so it starts on boot
