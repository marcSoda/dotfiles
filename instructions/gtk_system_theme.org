#+title: GTK System Theme

- some system applications respect the GTK theme that is set.
- I ran into this issue with `virt-manager`, but I'm sure many others are the same
- to globally enable a dark GTK theme:
#+BEGIN_SRC
sudo pacman -S arc-gtk-theme
sudo bash -c 'echo "[Settings]" > /etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini'
sudo bash -c 'echo "gtk-theme-name=Arc-Dark" >> /etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini'
#+END_SRC
