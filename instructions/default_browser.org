* this will change the default browser using xdg
- works for thunderbird and slack and probably a lot of other stuff
* steps
1. find .desktop entry for browser
   - .desktop entries are stored in `/usr/share/applications`
     - qutebrowser's is called org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser.dekstop for some reason
     - most of them are just <application_name>.desktop
   - create if necessary
     - create a .desktop entry for the browser (qutebrowser in this example) as ~/.local/share/applications/{name}.desktop
         #+BEGIN-SRC
         [Desktop Entry]
         Encoding=UTF-8
         Version=1.0
         Type=Application
         NoDisplay=true
         Exec=/usr/bin/qutebrowser %u
         Name=Qutebrowser
         Comment=Custom definition for Qutebrowser
         #+END-SRC
2. Run these in bash
   - xdg-mime default qutebrowser.desktop x-scheme-handler/http
   - xdg-mime default qutebrowser.desktop x-scheme-handler/https
3. Should work now
